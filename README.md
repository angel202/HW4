In problem one I simply created a triangle aside from the sphere that was already created.
I used help from this website: https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/ray-tracing-rendering-a-triangle/ray-triangle-intersection-geometric-solution

In problem II I added color and the phong shading. I used the ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting
from the previous homework. I added specific color to the sphere through the use of a constructor. I also 
added the color of the triangle in the main file. This allowed for two different colors. 

For part III I casted the shadow. I casted the shadow for the sphere correctly. But the triangle you can only 
see it when the background color is not black. This is due to an issue I was not able to fix in time. So 
I had to leave it as is. I did reference https://www.scratchapixel.com again. 

For part IIII unfortunately not being able to fully complete the previous task I also wasnt able 
to fully complete this task. I did manage to get the sphere to reflect light. But the triangle 
just looks dull. 

Other sources I used:

All my Header and CPP files are located in the src folder. That is the only way VS would let me run it. 

Also HW4-starter-code.VC GitHub would not allow me to install due to the file size.

It also would not let me install eigen-3.3.8, but I will place the link here to get it. https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/archive/3.3.8/eigen-3.3.8.zip


Aside from that all of the files I used to compile the code are located in this repository.
